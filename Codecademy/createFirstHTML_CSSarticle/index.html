    <h1>World, Why Won't You Say Hello Back?</h1>
    <h3>by: Timmy Bohmert</h3>
    <p>I am a future web developer, and I am learning a lot of different features and capabilities that I never even knew existed. It is exciting, new, freshing, and enjoyable.</p>
    <p>Though the different routes I have learned from taught various abilities, a common theme has been anoucing yours truly to the world. It has been enriching and delightful, freeing and open.</p>
    <p>Yet, when will the world reply back? I have always known him as a stubborn one (he has refused to change shape for the past 4.5 billion years), but nothing. Not even a text or call to let me know he is safe?</p>
    <p>Don't worry though, world, I still love you. </p>
