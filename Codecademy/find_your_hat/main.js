//project goals (provided by codecademy): In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.  

const prompt = require('prompt-sync')({sigint: true});

const hat = '^';
const hole = 'O';
const fieldCharacter = '░';
const pathCharacter = '*';

class Field {
  
}
