#Towers of Hanoi is an ancient mathematical puzzle that starts off with three stacks and many disks.

#The objective of the game is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.

#The game follows three rules:

#1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
#2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
#3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

#In this project, we are going to use our knowledge of stacks to implement this game! Letâ€™s get started!


#using stack.py with class for Stack with methods for push(), pop(), peek(), has_space(), is_empty(), get_size(), get_name(), print_items()



#creating stacks

#Create the Stacks

#instantiation of stack class for left, middle and right stacks

stacks.append(right_stack)

    num_disks = int(input('Enter a number greater than or equal to 3.\n'))


#for loop that iterates through the list of range of disks and pushes them to the left stack

for i in range(num_disks, 0, -1):
    left_stack.push(i)


#calculate the number of optimal moves. towers of hanoi, number of optimal moves is alwayy (2^number of disks) - 1

num_optimal_moves = 2 ** num_disks - 1
